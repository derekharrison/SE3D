# SE3D
Numerical solution of the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom. Numerical solution of the Schrodinger equation using the finite volume method. Some python scripts are added for generating an mp4 of a given simulation. The scripts require an executable ffmpeg.exe, which can be obtained at https://ffmpeg.org/.
